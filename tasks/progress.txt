## Codebase Patterns
- Use `pnpm run typecheck` from root to validate all packages
- Package structure: packages/core, packages/cli, packages/action
- Package names: @khoavhd/figma-sentinel-core, @khoavhd/figma-sentinel, @khoavhd/figma-sentinel-action
- Each package has its own tsconfig.json with NodeNext module resolution
- All packages extend tsconfig.base.json for shared compiler options
- Use .eslintrc.cjs for ESLint config (CommonJS for compatibility)
- vitest is installed at root level with --passWithNoTests for packages without tests
- Test files go in `src/__tests__/*.test.ts` within each package

- Initialized monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- Created root package.json with build, test, lint, typecheck scripts
- Created pnpm-workspace.yaml with packages: ['packages/*']
- Created packages/core, packages/cli, packages/action with package.json files
- Added MIT LICENSE file
- Added basic tsconfig.json for each package
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed:
  - package.json
  - pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - LICENSE
  - packages/core/package.json, packages/core/src/index.ts, packages/core/tsconfig.json
  - packages/cli/package.json, packages/cli/src/index.ts, packages/cli/tsconfig.json
  - packages/action/package.json, packages/action/src/index.ts, packages/action/tsconfig.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - tsup is used for building packages (ESM/CJS with dts)
  - vitest is used for testing
  - TypeScript devDependency is installed at root level

- Configured shared TypeScript and ESLint across all packages
- Created root tsconfig.json with project references to all packages
- Created tsconfig.base.json with shared compiler options (strict mode, noUnusedLocals, etc.)
- Updated each package tsconfig.json to extend tsconfig.base.json with composite: true
- Created .eslintrc.cjs with @typescript-eslint rules
- Created .prettierrc with consistent formatting settings
- Added ESLint and Prettier as root devDependencies
- Updated .gitignore to include *.tsbuildinfo
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added ESLint, Prettier deps, lint:fix and format scripts)
  - tsconfig.json (new - root with project references)
  - tsconfig.base.json (new - shared compiler options)
  - packages/core/tsconfig.json (extends base)
  - packages/cli/tsconfig.json (extends base, references core)
  - packages/action/tsconfig.json (extends base, references core)
  - .eslintrc.cjs (new)
  - .prettierrc (new)
  - .gitignore (added *.tsbuildinfo)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use .eslintrc.cjs (not .js) for CommonJS ESLint config
  - composite: true required in package tsconfigs for project references
  - cli and action packages reference core package

- Created core package types by cloning types.ts from source repository
- Exported all types: FigmaDirective, FigmaNode, NormalizedSpec, ChangelogEntry, SentinelConfig, etc.
- Updated packages/core/src/index.ts to re-export all types
- Added zod and fast-glob as dependencies in packages/core/package.json
- Package.json exports already configured for ESM and CommonJS (from US-001)
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed:
  - packages/core/src/types.ts (new)
  - packages/core/src/index.ts (updated)
  - packages/core/package.json (added dependencies)
  - pnpm-lock.yaml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `.js` extension in imports for ESM compatibility (e.g., `from './types.js'`)
  - All Figma-related types are in types.ts (FigmaNode, FigmaFill, FigmaEffect, etc.)
  - SentinelConfig defines the main configuration interface

- Migrated normalizer module from source to packages/core/src/normalizer.ts
- Updated imports to use local types with .js extension
- Exported normalizeNode, toStableJson, createNormalizer, NormalizerConfig from index.ts
- Cloned and adapted 18 tests to packages/core/src/__tests__/normalizer.test.ts
- Installed vitest at root level
- Updated cli and action packages to use --passWithNoTests
- All 18 normalizer tests pass
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed:
  - packages/core/src/normalizer.ts (new)
  - packages/core/src/__tests__/normalizer.test.ts (new)
  - packages/core/src/index.ts (added normalizer exports)
  - packages/cli/package.json (--passWithNoTests)
  - packages/action/package.json (--passWithNoTests)
  - package.json (added vitest)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Test assertions may need adjustment for sorted keys (color object keys sorted alphabetically)
  - Use `describe` blocks from vitest for test organization
