## Codebase Patterns
- Use `pnpm run typecheck` from root to validate all packages
- Package structure: packages/core, packages/cli, packages/action
- Package names: @khoavhd/figma-sentinel-core, @khoavhd/figma-sentinel, @khoavhd/figma-sentinel-action
- Each package has its own tsconfig.json with NodeNext module resolution

- Initialized monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- Created root package.json with build, test, lint, typecheck scripts
- Created pnpm-workspace.yaml with packages: ['packages/*']
- Created packages/core, packages/cli, packages/action with package.json files
- Added MIT LICENSE file
- Added basic tsconfig.json for each package
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed:
  - package.json
  - pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - LICENSE
  - packages/core/package.json, packages/core/src/index.ts, packages/core/tsconfig.json
  - packages/cli/package.json, packages/cli/src/index.ts, packages/cli/tsconfig.json
  - packages/action/package.json, packages/action/src/index.ts, packages/action/tsconfig.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - tsup is used for building packages (ESM/CJS with dts)
  - vitest is used for testing
  - TypeScript devDependency is installed at root level
